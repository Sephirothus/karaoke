            If the stars fall down on me,\nAnd the sun refused to shine,\nThen may the shackles be undone,\nMay all the old words cease to rhyme,\nIf the sky turned into stone,\nIt will matter not at all,\nFor there is no heaven in the sky,\nHell does not wait for our downfall!\n\nLet the voice of reason chime,\nLet the friars vanish for all time,\nGod\'s face is hidden, all unseen,\nYou can\'t ask him,\nWhat it all means,\nHe was never on your side,\nGod was never on your side,\nLet right or wrong alone decide,\nGod was never on your side.\n\nSee ten thousand ministries,\nSee the holy, righteous dogs,\nThey claim to heal,\nBut all they do is steal,\nAbuse your faith,\nCheat and rob,\n\nIf god is wise,\nWhy is he still,\nWhen these false prophets,\nCall him friend,\nWhy is he silent,\nIs he blind?!\nAre we abandoned in the end?\n\nLet the sword of reason shine,\nLet us be free of prayer and shrine,\nGod\'s face is hidden, turned way,\nHe never has a word to say,\nHe was never on your side,\nGod was never on your side,\nLet right or wrong alone decide!\nGod was never on your side!\nNo, no, no!\n\n(Guitar solo)\n\nHe was never on your side,\nGod was never on your side,\nNever!\nNever!\nNever!\nNever!\nNever on your side!\nNever on your side!\nGod was never on your side,\nNever on your side...
